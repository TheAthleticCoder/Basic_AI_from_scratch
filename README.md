# AI From Scratch

In this repository we implement algorithms such as:
1. KNNs
2. Decision Trees
3. Regressions and their variations 

We implement these algorithms from scratch without using any in-built libraries. It is very interesting to learn how to implement such functionalities from the ground-up since it improves understanding and intution of the basics.
